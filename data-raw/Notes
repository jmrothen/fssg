Developer Notes

Use these things for package development

devtools: check, build, document, load_all
    Maybes: reload, test (relies on testthat)

Rcpp: compileAttributes    (basically imports the cpp functions)
  -> PLEASE REMEMBER THIS


usethis: use_data, use_data_raw



Current items to add:
- General improvements to the GOF testing
  - PIT method
    - involves passing your times into p<dist> with the relevant fitted parameters, and then passing them into a histogram
    - if fit is good, then hist should look flatly uniform
    - can also pass into a ks.test with y='punif', or even goftest::ad.test
  - ks.test and ad.test more generally can be used to test goodness of a distribution
  - QQ plots
    - requires q-function of dist, and then you qqplot(q<dist>(ppoints(nrow(data)), parameters), sort(times)), and use abline(0,1) for ref?
  - CoxSnell residuals should be Exp(1)
- Consider adding methods for ancillary parameters (can be passed to flexsurvreg)
  - would likely require either new distribution objects or additional attributes on the object?

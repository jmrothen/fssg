\arguments{
\item{name}{Simple short hand name for the relevant distribution. flexsurv will search for the distribution functions using this name by default if the functions aren't explicitly defined. E.g. 'norm' for pnorm, dnorm, etc.}

\item{pars}{Vector of parameter names which will be provided to the relevant distribution functions.}

\item{location}{Name of the parameter which should be allowed to vary based on covariates.
The name 'location' is an artifact of the original flexsurv methodology, where it was assumed that the distributions were from a location-scale family.
flexsurv does provide the ability to allow for more than one parameter to vary through the 'anc' option, however this has not been adapted into fssg at this time.}

\item{transforms}{Vector of the functions which should be used to scale each parameter to the real number line.
If a parameter must be positive, then 'log' would scale the parameter to the real line.
This is used to pass parameters through to the optimization function.
If no transformation is needed, use 'identity'.}

\item{inv.transforms}{Vector of the inverse transformation functions for parameters. E.g. If transforms is 'log', inv.transforms would be 'exp'.}

\item{inits}{Function which will take a vector of times t and provide the initial parameter estimates.
Ideally these should be estimated using the times from the relevant dataset, but can also be arbitrary initial values such as 1.}

\item{d}{Density function of the relevant distribution, such as dnorm.
If not supplied, flexsurv will search the global environment for a p-function using the name paramater.
If one is not found, flexsurv will attempt to search for a hazard function instead (hnorm).
If this fails, flexsurv will not be able to model.}

\item{p}{Distribution function of the relevant distribution, such as pnorm.
If not supplied, flexsurv will search the global environment for a p-function using the name paramater.
In the case that one is not found, then flexsurv will estimate one using integration, which will slow the process considerably.}

\item{q}{Quantile function for the relevant distribution, such as qnorm.
fssg provides a helper function (quantilify) to approximate q functions based on a p function.}

\item{h}{Hazard function of the relevant distribution.
Not required, but may be supplied instead of a d function if that is preferred.}

\item{H}{Cumulative hazard function.
If not provided, and h function is being used for modeling, then flexsurv will estimate a cumulative hazard function, which will slow the process considerably.}

\item{fullname}{Alternative name for the distribution. This is used for naming of ooutputs generated by}
}
\description{
flexsurv allows for the creating of custom distributions, which must follow a specific format to use the flexsurv functions.
FSSG uses a modified version of this formatting, which specifies the relevant distribution functions directly.
}
\details{
FSSG distributions should be specified as a list, with the following attributes.
